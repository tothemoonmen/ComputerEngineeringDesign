Functions that need to be implemented:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Reading Point Clouds: Use o3d.io.read_point_cloud() to import point cloud data from your LiDAR system. Downsampling: Apply voxel_down_sample() to reduce data density, which helps in efficient processing. OPEN3D Noise Removal: Utilize remove_statistical_outlier() to eliminate noise from the point cloud.

Feature Extraction: Normal Estimation: Compute surface normals using estimate_normals(), essential for understanding the geometry of the object. OPEN3D Keypoint Detection: Identify significant points with compute_iss_keypoints().

Segmentation and Clustering: Plane Segmentation: Use segment_plane() to detect planar surfaces, which can help in isolating the solar panel from other structures. Clustering: Apply cluster_dbscan() for clustering points, aiding in distinguishing different components of the debris. OPEN3D

Transformation and Alignment: Registration: Align multiple point clouds using registration_icp() to create a coherent model. Transformation Estimation: Estimate the rotational axis and speed by analyzing transformations between successive point clouds.

Visualization: Rendering: Visualize point clouds and meshes with o3d.visualization.draw_geometries(), facilitating inspection and analysis. OPEN3D

Integration with Camera Data: RGB-D Integration: Combine depth and color information using create_rgbd_image_from_color_and_depth(), enabling enhanced object characterization.
